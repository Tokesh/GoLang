About project:
I tried to recreate the store database, where we contain information about store, clients, vendors and orders. I created generators(on python language) to insert data to tables.
I tried to optimally store information that can be used for data analysis. I also created a couple of additional columns in the form of payment, deliveries.
It was the most pleasant for me to work with this project. I consolidated my knowledge in the field of table normalization, I also remembered themes like 'joins'.
